# Password randomizer (password randomizer.cpp)
 
Create a program that allows the user to enter a password. The program then should create and display a new password using the rules.
Use a sentinel value to end the program. 
 
1. All vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) in the original password should be replaced with the letter X.
2. All numbers in the original password should be replaced with the letter Z.
3. All of the characters in the original password should be reversed. 
 
 
 
# Pig latin translator (pig latin converter.cpp [reworked])
 
Create a program that allows the user to enter a word. The program should display the word in pig latin form.
The rules for converting a word into pig latin form are listed in. Use a sentinel value to end the program. 
1. When the word begins with a vowel (A, E, I, O, or U), add the string “-way” (a dash followed by the letters w, a, and y) to the end of the word.
For example, the pig latin form of the word “ant” is “ant-way”. 
2. When the word does not begin with a vowel, first add a dash to the end of the word.
Then continue moving the first character in the word to the end of the word until the first character is the letter A, E, I, O, U, or Y.
Then add the string “ay” to the end of the word. For example, the pig latin form of the word “Chair” is “airChay”. 
3. When the word does not contain the letter A, E, I, O, U, or Y, add the string “way” to the end of the word.
For example, the pig latin form of “56” is “56-way”.
